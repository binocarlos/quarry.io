  Quarry.io - Container
  ---------------------

  The main unit in the quarry.io stack

  A container provides a wrapper for a list of container base models

  Much like jQuery (which wraps DOM elements) - this wraps Backbone models

  Each base container has a supply chain & routing - it can stand alone

/*

  Returns a factory function to create new containers

  This allows you to customize the container and model behaviour
  before they are instantiated
