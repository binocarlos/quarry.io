	the list of departments within a quarry

	each department represents a section within a joblist

	one worker is able to run all departments (a worker is a process abstraction
	so it does not care what code it is running)
	
	not all departments are required in a joblist

	the required (autocreated) ones are:

		router 					-> HTTP router

		web							-> HTTP server

		reception				-> Quarry router

		switchboard			-> pub/sub
		portal					-> pub/sub

		warehouse				-> Quarry server
			function
			contract
			supplier

	services are then booted on warehouse workers
