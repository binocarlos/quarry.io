  Quarry.io - Warehouse
  ---------------------

  The main co-ordinating class for dealing with packets

  The warehouse is basically a router for supply chains

  It presents a middleware stack

  You add middleware based on a route - the packet.route is used

  The middleware is a

    function(req, res, next)

  It does not think about the packet

  the request and response are hooked up by the warehouse

  The warehouse will have supply chains associated with it which packets can be routed to
