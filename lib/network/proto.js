  quarry.io - network proto

  the overall co-ordinator of the stacks and their services

  the network is a server that will boot up quarry stacks on the resources provided

  it knows about 2 things:

    the instances (and other resources like DNS) that are physically available
    and how to ask for more / shut some down dependent upon load

    the allocation of a stack onto those instances

    how a stack is allocated to one physical network is dependent upon the stack's profile

    this describes the maximum budget and characteristics of the automatic scaling a stack
    can do

    the network is the boss of this however because ultimately it owns the resources
    that are available

    a stack can only 'ask' the network for stuff not expect it
