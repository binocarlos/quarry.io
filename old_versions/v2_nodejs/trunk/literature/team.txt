The Team

Dan Baker - Arch Overload

Dan is, literally, the man.  Think Harvey Keitel from Pulp Fiction.  Dan makes things happen, like Quarry JS for example.

Kai Davenport - Scientist

Kai is REBU (he is uber and backwards).  He dosn't have a facebook account but knows how to write a multiuser application on Facebook - go figure.

Graeme Robinson - Foreman

Apart from being South African, Graeme has many redeeming qualities - like being ace at looking after all the quarries in the world for instance.

Bhavesh Bhavan - Fixer

When Bhav smiles, the world is happy.  He will hold your hand in moments of despair and make sure your quarry machinery is working as it should.

Jack Otis Barker - Jeweller

Jack looks after the gem-stone vault and has a propensity to wear diamonds head to toe - somehow (being a very dapper chap), he pulls it off.
