  Quarry.io Supply Chain
  ----------------------

  reduce a selector by splitting it into the various parts

  the endpoint is a supply_chain that can run a 'selector' stage

  the router is either a function to which every stage is piped or an
  object to which the named stages are piped

  the router lets you force results to be sent back over the wire
  before continuing

  if the router does not match - the request is simply reduced in process
  and ends-up at the end-point

  this gives you total control over how and when the results leave the endpoint
  process to be filtered
