META & CHILDREN SPLIT & DEEP MODELS
-----------------------------------

purpose: to allow a PURE backbone model to be the data
the class this pure backbone model uses can be defined easily from any class

the meta model is a core model
the children collection is a core collection


a tree of container data is ALWAYS converted to models recursivly

when containers are transmitting over the network - they generally are
not opened so we can say when they are it must be as deep models not shallow

outcome: when you write to a container the data MUST be present in the underlying
attributes of the model - at the moment it's all confused because of the nested data
/ container wrapper

the container stil wraps the array of models and does so for children descendents

The model itself should be as light as possible




1. split container data and meta data into two models

2. the meta methods point into a generic META backbone model

3. the attr methods point into the 'data'

4. the meta describes what the data is

5. generally it is a generic backbone model but could be anything
