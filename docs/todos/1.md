Suppliers

End-points that can respond to packets in an RPC style

Suppliers can be thought of as REST end-points - indeed they offer their API over REST in some cases.

Types:

	- RAM - generic supplier that is passed RAW container data and manages access via internal in-memory find commands

	- FILE

		- JSONFILE - RAW container data that is used to bootstrap a RAM supplier
		- XMLFILE - XML container data that is used to bootstrap a RAM supplier
		- YAMLFILE - YAML container data that is used to bootstrap a RAM supplier

	- FILESYSTEM

		- ZEROFS - amazing in-memory fast-as-*** file storage - gold-dust
		- QUICKFS - local folder on-webserver for fast delivery - best for .htmls and .less etc - silver standard
		- QUARRYFS - MongoFS backed big storage for users - best for photo collections quick and massive - bronze is average investment
		- CLOUDFOLDER - remote FS from a fog machine - best for connecting to legacy cloud files and/or remoting onto other folders - free as in remote beer/compare the Meerkats
		- CLOUDARCHIVE - remote archive folder from a fog machine - best for massive data that you might need one a year (like analysis logs etc) - Amazon Glacier

	- DOCUMENT

		- QUARRYDB - MONGO database tuned for the container format
		- MONGO - vanilla Mongo Collection - selectors much reduced
		...

	- KEY/VALUE

		- REDIS - local quick data-structures for useful stuff (like users) - mostly pre-prgrammed but easy to create new ones

	- IMAGE

		- Flickr, Google Images, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram

	- EMAIL

		- POP, IMAP, Google, Exchange

	- SOCIAL

		- Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter

	- FINANCIAL

		- Yahoo, Google

	- NEWS

		- BBC, etc

	- WEB

		- scraper

	- INFO

		- Wikipedia

	- SQL
		- MYSQL - MySQL database - the supplier can use the SCHEMA to work out how to interpret selectors across the tables
		- POSTGRESQL - POSTGreSQL database - the supplier can use the SCHEMA to work out how to interpret selectors across the tables
		...

Jobs:

	- select (run selector and return array of results - tree mode determines what depth _children has)
	- put (upload container data - upsert with parent id for append)
	- move (internally remap the location of containers - input is just ids)
	- get (get by id - return value depends upon input (array / single object))
	- delete

Server Side Warehouse Routing

This is the Express inspired method of having a warehouse that can route different styles of request to different end-points.

A good example is one request that resolves to 2 different database types, one Mongo the other MySQL...

We might have an entire cloud stack for Mongo requests and in a different location one for MySQL...

In this case - the 'route' property yielded by the database pointer will container the respective protocol:

mongo://
mysql://

The warehouse routing can use:

	protocol (mongo://, quarrydb://, facebook:// etc)
	method (select, put, etc)

For it's string based routing

Or it can define a function that will analyse the packet itselfs and decide what to do

Jobs:
	
	- reducers that point into supply chains
	- branching reducers that enable multiple reductions to be merged
	- middleware stack execution with packet function pre-loading
	- sort out packet routing technique
	- make HTTP request packet wrapper

Supply Chain
