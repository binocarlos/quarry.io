computers versus humans

computers operate at blinding speeds but on the most basic
of levels - big problems are solved by combining lots of
little solutions.

humans operate at a snails pace in comparison but can work
with difficult ideas and concepts.

the bridge between those 2 worlds is the programmer.

in my humble opinion, software that has the DNA of a computer
as opposed to a human, is better and more rewarding to work on.

this entails software that consists of lots of little bits speaking
to each other (like a computer works) rather than one single
entity of understanding (like a human works).
