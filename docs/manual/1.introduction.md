#The Basics
quarry.io is a database platform for web designers.

It's primary language is CSS selectors just like jQuery.

##jQuery Syntax
It turns out that CSS is quite a powerful database language.

Let us look at some very simple jQuery goodness.

A simple snippet of HTML:

		<div id="products">
			<div class="product">
				<span id="title">Pillowcase</span>
				<span id="price" data-price="12">12</span>
				<img src=".." />
			</div>
			<div class="product">
				<span id="title">Table</span>
				<span id="price" data-price="45">45</span>
				<img src=".." />
			</div>
		</div>

So - we are displaying a shop and have 2 products on the page
(a pillowcase @ £12 and a table @ £45).

Let us use some jQuery to put a link on each title:

		$('.product #title').click(function(){
			// do stuff
		})

What we have done is 'search' the DOM and our search term is:

		.product #title

Which means - any DOM element that has the id of 'title' and lives within
an element with a classname of 'product'

###The DOM is a tree
The selector above has performed something naturally that every SQL database
finds very un-natural - 'searching a tree'.

Browsers understand trees - they are built that way, when you load a HTML string,
the browser builds the DOM out of it.

The DOM is a tree of elements - each having 'children'.

CSS selectors allow you to search the tree naturally.

		div.parent > span.directchild

says spans 'directly' inside the parent

		div.ancestor span.descendent img.furtherdescendent

the above is a 3 layer tree query.

###Tree with Attribute Filters
So CSS selectors let us search trees nicely - but they also let us search attributes:

		span[data-price=12]

Will search anything that has data-price=12 - combining this into a tree query:
