#Instructions
We are going to build an online shop that can sell our products.

You don't need any technical skills to do this, just the ability to read this guide.

##Step 1
Every database needs feeding with some data before it can be useful.

The first thing is to create some products we want to sell by uploading them into a folder.

Login to your quarry desktop and create a new project called 'shop'.

Within that project add a folder called 'products'.

##Step 2
Now you can create lots of products you want to sell.

Click the 'add' button and click 'product'.

Type the name, price and description of each product you want to sell.

##Step 3
Go back into your project, click add, then click 'online shop'.

The form will ask 'what folder do your products live in'.

Choose the folder you just put your products into.

##Step 4
You are done!

The form will show you a URL - this is where your shop now lives.
