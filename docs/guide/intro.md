#Day 1
Welcome to work!

Anticipation is in the air, the robots are ready and some brand new
quarry machinery is looking smart.

##Health and safety
Before we begin, a safety briefing...

The speed at which quarry containers move and their occasionally rapid change of 
direction has been known to confuse and surprise some people.

Please do not be alarmed - containers have neither mass nor gravitational pull
and therefore cannot hit anything.

Equally - the quarry radio and portal system both operate within Ultra Cable Band and so
will not affect your TV.

One VERY important point however - NEVER, under ANY circumstances, press the red button.

Right - now the paper work is done, lets get to work!

##The Training Course
This section has been removed because I never read this part and always just jump to the next part.

##The Proper Thing
The switchboard has just issued an emergency DEFCON 5 client request.

ACME inc. has just requested a product database with online store.

The problem is they need it within 2 hours flat and have no information about the products to go on it
(apparently Coyote stole the list).

How can we use our quarry machinery to build such a thing?

Well, the tattered dog-eared booklet entitled 'How to build such a thing', lying just on the desk,
is very welcome right now.

###How to build such a thing
The starting point will be to create a new project.

Login to your quarry - click the 'Projects' button and click 'New'.

Type ACME Shop as the name and click save - you now have a brand new project ready to go.

So, lets set about building the ACME product shop.

####The Product Database
ACME will need a place to login and add their products (they change them all the time as Coyote
highlights the design flaws in previous product lines).

Inside of your newly created product - click 'Add' and then 'Folder'.

Call the new Folder 'Products' and then click save.

Double click the 'Products' folder and then click 'Add' then 'Container'.

####Blueprints
We are about to create a 'blueprint'.

Blueprints describe what fields a new type of container will have.

We are going to create a 'product' blueprint so ACME can use it to create 100's of products.

For our product database we want:

 * Name
 * Price
 * Description

So - click 'Add Field' 3 times, entering the 3 field names above.
