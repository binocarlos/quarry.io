#Deployment
A deployment is a top level arragement of stacks and resources.

Each deployment operates in isolation from other deployments - it is the top level in the quarry.io ecosystem.

The role of a deployment is to manage 3 things:

 * Resources - connect off to IaaS companies and create/destroy computers and cloud computing services

 * Stacks - look after the arrangement of stacks in the deployment

 * Deployment - uploading and booting code on worker machines
