#The Intro
quarry.io is a computer system with one basic purpose:

	To extract value from data.

Data is everywhere in our world - there is a seething mass of it:

	What time is it? Who won the football? What price is oil?
	Is it raining? How fast am I going? Who is talking about so and so?

How do we make use of this valuable pool of insight?

Databases.
