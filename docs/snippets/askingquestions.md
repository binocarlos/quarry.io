As Gordon Ghecko once said:

	the most valuable commodity I know? Information

I struggled to get my head around this.  In my simplistic
world 'value' was the domain of things I could touch and feel,
even eat, like cake - cake is valuable, information is not tasty.

The flour to make the cake however, that required information in
order to be grown and ground down into a useful powder.

The original idea of 'if you put this seed into the ground, it will grow 
some Wheat' grew into the worldwide culinary mix we have today.

Without information - there would be no cake and everyone would be
sat around grumpy eating leaves.

In order for progress to occur, different ideas and sources of information 
must collide and create new ideas and information.

The DNA of human progress can be thought of as this evolution of ideas,
beginning with some early ones like 'plant this seed' and 'do what I say
or you will go to hell' and moving onto some modern ones like 'the Higgs
is why stuff has mass' and 'do what you feel, nobody goes to hell'.
